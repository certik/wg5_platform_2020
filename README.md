# WG5 Convenor Platform

I am running for the WG5 Convenor position and this is my platform. I put it on
GitHub and I invite the Fortran community to open up issues and Pull Requests
(PRs) to discuss and further refine the platform.

## Original Platform

The original platform from 4/21/2020 when I
[announced](https://ondrejcertik.com/blog/2020/04/running-for-wg5-convenor-announcement/) my run for the Convenor is
in the file:

* [platform_and_experience.pdf](https://github.com/certik/wg5_platform_2020/raw/df680860bb64800f8c48d247947957a8745fb903/platform_and_experience.pdf)

## Platform open to edits

I then extracted just the text from my original platform and posted it as a
Markdown document:

* [platform.md](./platform.md)

You are welcome to issue PRs towards this document.
